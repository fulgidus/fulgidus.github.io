## Summary:

- ### CSS Capabilities Beyond Basic Styling:
  - Discovered that CSS offers advanced features like `:has` and `text-wrap`, among others, which can significantly enhance web design capabilities.

- ### Order of Trying Out New Features:
  1. **HTML:** Start with HTML to structure content.
  2. **CSS:** Use CSS for styling and advanced features like `:has` selector.
  3. **JS:** Incorporate JavaScript for dynamic behavior and interactivity.

- ### Advanced CSS Selectors:

  - #### `:has` Selector:
    - Allows selecting an element based on its state or the presence of specific children.
    Examples:
      ```css
      element:has(.child) {
      }
      element:has(> .direct-child) {
      }
      element:has(:state) {
      }
      element:has(:state) .child {
      }
      ```
    - Supports boolean logic:
      ```css
      element:has(:not(:state)) {
      }
      element:has(.logical, .or) {
      }
      element:has(.logical):has(.and) {
      }
      ```
    - **❗ Feature Detection:**
      ```css
      @supports selector(figure:has(caption)) {
        figure:has(caption) {
          // define stuff
        }
      }
      ```
    - **⚠️ Caveats:**
      - Not forgiving; use `:where` for more lenient selection.
      - Takes the highest specificity of argument selectors.
      - Keep selectors as specific as possible to avoid performance issues.

    - #### `:range` Selector:
    - Utilizes `:nth-child(n + B)` and `:nth(-n + B)` to count elements based on specific conditions.
      Example:
        ```css
        :nth-child(An + B of .selector) {
        }
        ```
    - Can also use division to count with `An` and `:last-child`.

- ### Text Wrapping Enhancements:

  - #### Typographically Accurate Text Wrapping:
    - `text-wrap: balance;`: Aligns line ends to maintain a rectangular shape.
    - `text-wrap: pretty;`: Avoids single-word orphans in the last line of paragraphs.

- ### Scroll-Driven Animations:
  - Explore scroll-driven animations using resources like [scroll-driven-animations.style](https://scroll-driven-animations.style) (best viewed in Chrome).
  - How to implement:
    1. Remove time component from animation.
    2. Make easing linear.
    3. Add `animation-timeline: scroll(block root);`.
  - #### ❗ Scroll Direction Detection:
